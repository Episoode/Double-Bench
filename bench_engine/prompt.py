# Visual Element fliter  prompt
VISUAL_FILTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
You are a strict document image analyst for document-based RAG systems, 
specializing in evaluating whether images can support the generation of high-quality Q&A pairs.
Carefully evaluate each image's content following these guidelines:

## Core Objective  
Analyze the provided image and its surrounding page text to determine whether the content of image can effectively support generating factually grounded QA pairs for document-based RAG systems.

## Evaluation Criteria  
1. **Essential Content Requirements**  
   - The image must exhibit  semantic cohesion with its surrounding text content  
   - Visual elements should convey self-contained informational completeness  
   - Demonstrate capacity to generate verifiable factual statements  
2. **Exclusion Imperatives**  
   Automatically reject images displaying:  
   - Decorative non-functionality 
   - Semantic ambiguity preventing definitive interpretation  
   - Information density below operational thresholds  
   - Contextual detachment from document flow  
   - Appendices, reference lists, and other images that do not contain specific meaningful information

## Response Requirements  
- Strictly respond with "Yes" or "No" only  .
- "Yes" indicates the if the visual/textual content of the image can effectively support generating factually grounded QA pairs
- "No" indicates the if the visual/textual don't content of the image can effectively support generating factually grounded QA pairs

# Singlehop QA Generation Text Prompt
SINGLEHOP_QA_TEXT_PROMPT = '''
Generate one QA pair based on the following guideline:

**Question Requirements:**
- Create self-contained questions requiring no contextual knowledge from other pages
- Focus on explicitly mentioned key entities, concepts, or processes
- Avoid page-specific references (e.g., "in this section" or "as mentioned above")
- Include both factual questions (who/what/when) and explanatory questions (how/why)

**Answer Specifications:**
- Answers may be moderately summarized but must strictly adhere to source content
- Prohibit any speculation or supplementation beyond original text

**Format Rules:**
- Response must be in JSON format containing "question" and "answer" fields

example response:
{
  "question": "What are the clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease?",
  "answer": "Diagnosis requires bradykinesia combined with either resting tremor or rigidity, often presenting with asymmetric onset."
}

# Singlehop QA Generation  Prompt(Image)
SINGLEHOP_QA_IMG_PROMPT = '''
Generate a QA pair based on the following guideline:

**Question Requirements:**
- Formulate globally valid questions without image-dependent references,Expressions such as 'in the image/table' or 'according to' are prohibited.

- Focus on key visual elements:  meaningful knowledge and insights rather than superficial visual elements
•Prioritize questions that: 
Extract domain-specific knowledge，Identify key patterns and relationships，Explore underlying mechanisms or principles，Analyze trends and their implications，Examine cause-and-effect relationships
  • Avoid trivial questions about:
Simple counting of visual elements，Basic visual descriptions，Surface-level observations，Generic image properties

- Employ diverse question types and perspectives:
What/When/How/where/Which

**Answer Specifications:**
- Answers must strictly derive from image content but not captions/context
- Prohibit extrapolation beyond visually verifiable information
- Focus on providing substantive, knowledge-rich responses

**Format Rules:**
- Response must be in JSON format containing "question" and "answer" fields

Example response:
{
  "question": "How does the introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms correlate with industrial emission reduction rates across different sectors in 2009?",
  "answer": "Manufacturing sectors showed a 30% reduction in emissions after carbon pricing implementation, while energy sectors achieved a 45% reduction, demonstrating stronger responsiveness to the policy."

4. Reason about whether any ambiguity might be introduced by the combination

Your goal is to seamlessly integrate the first question into the second question by replacing 
a specific entity reference. The combined question should:
1. Be grammatically correct and flow naturally
2. **Avoid awkward phrases like "the entity that..." or "the thing which..."**
3. Maintain the original meaning and logical connection between questions

MULTIHOP_QA_FILTER_PROMPT = """
You are an strict expert in knowledge graph reasoning and natural language question generation quality assessment. Your task is to rigorously evaluate a provided multi-hop reasoning question and its underlying reasoning steps based on a set of strict quality criteria. You must analyze the entire reasoning path, from the initial step to the final question and answer, to determine if the question is high-quality, unambiguous, logically sound, and meaningful.

Evaluate the following multi-hop reasoning question and its construction process based on the criteria provided below.

**Question Data:**

Initial Question: {initial_question}
Initial Answer (Entity ID): {initial_answer}

Final Question: {final_question}
Final Answer (Entity ID): {final_answer}

**Reasoning Steps (Logical Flow and Chaining):**
{steps_description}

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  **Final Question Clarity and Context Independence:**
    * The `Final Question` must be clearly, fluently, and naturally phrased and must be understandable and answerable.
    * The `Final Answer` entity name must NOT be present within the `Final Question` text itself.
    * The `Final Question` should be specific enough to uniquely identify the `Final Answer` given the preceding context established by the question.
    * The `Final Question` and the questions generated in each step (`Step Question` and `Cumulative Question`s) must avoid artificial phrasing like "the entity that...", "the thing which...", etc. and sound like a natural human question.

2.  **Necessity of Reasoning Steps:**
    * Every intermediate step described in the `Reasoning Steps` section must be logically essential to derive the `Final Answer` starting from the knowledge implied by the `Initial Question`.
    * For `step question',the answer should correspond to the question. The answer should not be random or irrelevant.
    * Removing *any* of the intermediate steps should break the logical chain required to answer the `Final Question`. The chain must be strictly sequential and dependent.

3.  **Rigor and Uniqueness of Steps:**
    * For each individual step (from `current_node` to `next_node` via `relation_text`), the relation and the `Step Question` (`question_before_replace`) must be specific enough to imply a *unique* `answer` (`next_node`) within the context of a typical broad knowledge base(**MOST IMPORTANT**). Avoid relations that could apply to many things (e.g., Avoid "is related to").
    * The entity name that is the `answer` for a specific step must NOT appear directly within the `Step Question` (`question_before_replace`) for that any step.
    * The logical flow of the chain (`Cumulative Question After This Step`) should correctly integrate the step question.

4.  **Significance:**
    * The `Final Question` must address a meaningful query about the entities and their relationships. It should not be trivial, overly generic, or based on obscure connections that lack practical or informational value. The question should feel like something a person might genuinely ask.

Based on your evaluation, first provide a brief textual explanation (`reason`) summarizing your evaluation and conclusion (why it passed or failed).

Then, provide your final decision as a JSON object with two keys:
* `reason`: (string) Your explanation as described above.
* `keep`: (string) Must be either "yes" or "no`.

Return ONLY the JSON object after your explanation.

Question_Refinement_Prompt = '''
You are an expert specializing in query analysis and refinement for a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system. Your primary function is to disambiguate user questions by making them more specific.

##Task Definition:
Your objective is to refine an ambiguous Original Question by leveraging a designated Ground Truth Image and
contrasting it with several irrelevant distractor images.

##Instructions:
  • You will be given a question, a single Ground Truth Image (which will always be the first image provided), and one
or more distractor images.
  • Your task is to analyze the Original Question and compare the Ground Truth Image against the distractor images.By
contrasting them, identify the key, distinguishing detail within the Ground Truth Image that makes it the unique and
correct answer to the question. This detail should be absent or different in the distractor images.
  • Finally, rewrite the Original Question to create a new, more precise Refined Question that seamlessly incorporates
this key detail, making the question unambiguous.

##Format Instructions:
Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with exactly two keys::
  • reason: A string containing your reasoning process.
  • question: Your refined question.
